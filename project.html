                    <h3>Intro to Networking: Case Study</h3>
                    <p>This project involved creating a network for different buildings. 
                        My partner and I desgined a unique IPv4 addressing scheme, and implemented this into our network. 
                        The main purpose of this project was to learn VLSM teqchniques.</p>

                    <h3>Computer Architecture: ARMv7 vs RISC-V</h3>
                    <p>This project involved exploring the differences between the two architecture's: ARMv7 and RISC-V.
                        An arithmetic calculator was created using both arcitectures and was later compared, to see which was better.
                        The differences between memory and storage, termination as well as computation was explored.

                    <h3>Law and Ethics: Privacy in the Modern Age</h3>
                    <p>This presentation was created for my Law and Ethics class. It outlined the problems with privacy within the digital world,
                        and how our information is not that safe. Particular cases were studied, such as the Playstation hack in 2011, and it showed
                        how users data was stolen and how easily personal information can be retrieved.

                    <h3>Cryptography Assignment</h3>
                    <p>One of our assignments in my Cryptography class was based around a number of different ciphers. Using Playfair ciphers, or Hill, we encrypted manny different plaintext.
                        The most interesting was using Kasiski analysis to crack ciphered text using Vigenere cipher. A report was done on that, and showed step-by-step how to decrypt the text.
