a)Desktop viewport: 960px >
  Tablet viewport: 481px - 959px
  Phone viewport: 480px <

  The reason for these dimensions is due to the average screen sizes. Desktops screens are larger, so anything greater than 960 will usually
be a desktop. Tablets are the middle size, and phones are usally small. EXPAND.

b) I used a linear gradient on all of my pages as the main page background. 

c) The color scheme I chose to use for my main website is: /*Color Scheme:#2F8BED, #4D30F0, #0027EB, #10BFEB, #7807F0, #8C9CED*/.
I chose this color scheme as it is a harmonious color scheme around the gradiations of a color, in my case blue. I restriced
myself to 5 different colors, as any more would make my site too crowded and not visually appealing. The harmonious color scheme's
main color was blue, but shades such as purples, lilac, and aqua colors were used. I find the contrast with these colors to work very well.
