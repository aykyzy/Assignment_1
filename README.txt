2a)Desktop viewport: 960px >
  Tablet viewport: 481px - 959px
  Phone viewport: 480px <

The reason for these dimensions is due to the average screen sizes. Desktops screens are larger, so anything greater than 960 will usually
be a desktop. Tablets are the middle size, and phones are usally small. In order to utilize the viewports, media quiries were used to make
the webpage responsive, but also so it looks nice on all devices. For example, in different viewports, my about page is stacked horizontally
on the desktop as its a wider screen, but vertically on phone as its a much smaller screen.

2b) I used a linear gradient on all of my pages as the main page background. The angular gradient of 121deg was used in my forms page.

2c) The color scheme I chose to use for my desktop viewport is: /*Color Scheme:#2F8BED, #4D30F0, #0027EB, #10BFEB, #7807F0, #8C9CED*/.
I chose this color scheme as it is a harmonious color scheme around the gradiations of a color, in my case blue. I restriced
myself to 5 different colors, as any more would make my site too crowded and not visually appealing. The harmonious color scheme's
main color was blue, but shades such as purples, lilac, and aqua colors were used. I find the contrast with these colors to work very well.

The color scheme I used for my tablet and phone viewport is: /*Color Scheme: #F7BF52, #F7E752, #F7D352, #F7A852, #FA3346 */. I also used the
harmonious color scheme, but the reason I changed the color scheme was because smaller devices should have a higher contrast color scheme,
as it makes it easier to view on smaller screens. yellows, red and black text really pop making it easier to read.
